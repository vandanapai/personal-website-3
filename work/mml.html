                        <h4>Major broadcasting company, Turner Sports, wanted to redesign the Windows mobile and desktop applications for the NCAA March Madness Tournament for spring 2015. The existing app deviated from its iOS and Android counterparts, and it was important to our client to maintain cross-platform parity. I joined the team as the lead designer, responsible for redesigning the main landing view and the new concept of team pages, all while staying true to the existing MML design style.</h4>

                               Our client had come up with new designs and concepts for the spring 2015 March Madness season, but these were set specifically for their iOS and Android apps. However, they needed our expertise to adapt these designs for Windows 8 Mobile and Desktop. The Windows platform has a very specific design style that uses tiles and horizontal scrolling to explore content. This can be very limiting, especially when trying to create a consistent experience across all platforms. As much as our client would have liked, we could not use the same iOS and Android conventions and navigation paradigms and just slap them onto Windows.
