                        <h4>My intern project at Vertigo was to create an iOS application for Stew Ellington’s book, “901 Very Good Cocktails,” which was created to help you find the perfect cocktail to make. Unable to reference this book on-the-go, our CEO, Scott Stanfield, wanted to transform it into an iOS app to quickly find a drink recipe wherever you are. </h4>
