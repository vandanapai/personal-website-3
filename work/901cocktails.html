                        <h4>My intern project at Vertigo was to create an iOS application for the book, “901 Very Good Cocktails,” a specially curated guide to Stew Ellington's favorite cocktails.  The book has a ton of content: 901 cocktails with specific methods and ingredients, over 200 ingredients, and 50 categories. Our goal was to ensure the user could find the perfect cocktail faster using the app than with the book. </h4>

                               Nailing down browse and search was absolutely critical, and I began with heavy competitive analysis of other food apps, and any other content-heavy apps with powerful search functionality. Breaking down the book, I translated it into an information architecture map. This helped me to understand how the content was related to each other, which informed the different paths the user could take to complete tasks with the fewest possible taps.
